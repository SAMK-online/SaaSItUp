# SaaSItIs MVP - Setup Guide

## ✅ Installation Complete!

All dependencies have been installed successfully. You're almost ready to run the demo!

## 🔑 Next Step: Set Your OpenAI API Key

You need an OpenAI API key to run the multi-agent system. Here's how to set it up:

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended for Demo)

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-actual-api-key-here'
```

### Option 2: .env File (Recommended for Development)

Create a `.env` file in this directory:

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here" > .env
```

Replace `sk-your-actual-api-key-here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### How to Get an OpenAI API Key

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (it starts with `sk-`)
5. Use it in one of the methods above

## 🧪 Verify Setup

Run the test script to make sure everything is ready:

```bash
python3 test_setup.py
```

You should see all ✅ green checkmarks!

## 🚀 Run the Demo

Once your API key is set, start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📋 Demo Walkthrough

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering
Enter your SaaS requirements in natural language. Try this example:

```
We need an observability platform for our microservices architecture running on Kubernetes. 
It must integrate with our GitHub workflow for deployment tracking and send alerts to Slack. 
We need sub-2-second latency monitoring and SOC2 compliance for our enterprise customers. 
Our budget is around $50K annually and we have about 50 engineers who will use it.
```

### Step 2: Vendor Matching
The AI will analyze the vendor database and rank the best matches based on your requirements.

### Step 3: POC Evaluation
The system creates a custom weighted rubric for evaluating vendors during POCs.

### Step 4: Final Recommendations
Get executive-ready recommendations with confidence scores and adoption predictions.

## 📊 What to Expect

- **Processing Time**: Each step takes 30-60 seconds (AI is thinking!)
- **Tokens Used**: ~5000-10000 tokens per complete workflow
- **Cost**: Approximately $0.10-$0.30 per demo run with GPT-4

## 🎯 Hackathon Tips

### For Your Presentation:
1. Have the app running before you present
2. Use the example input provided above
3. Emphasize the multi-agent architecture
4. Highlight the structured POC evaluation innovation
5. Show the confidence scoring mechanism

### Demo Script:
See `demo_script.md` for a detailed 5-minute presentation walkthrough

### Pitch Document:
See `hackathon-pitch.md` for the one-page problem/solution document

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "OPENAI_API_KEY not found"
- Make sure you've set the environment variable or created the .env file
- Restart your terminal after setting environment variables
- Run `python3 test_setup.py` to verify

### "Module not found" errors
- Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` again
- Make sure you're in the `/Users/abdulshaik/SaasItUp` directory

### Streamlit not found
- The streamlit command might not be in your PATH
- Try: `python3 -m streamlit run app.py`

### Agent errors during runtime
- Check your OpenAI API key is valid
- Ensure you have sufficient OpenAI credits
- Check your internet connection

## 💡 Optional Enhancements

If you have extra time before the hackathon:

1. **Add More Vendors**: Edit `vendor_matching_agent.py` to add more vendor categories
2. **Customize Rubrics**: Modify `poc_evaluation_agent.py` to adjust evaluation criteria
3. **Enhance UI**: Customize the Streamlit interface in `app.py`
4. **Add Visualizations**: Create charts showing vendor comparisons

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your multi-agent SaaS consultant MVP is ready to go. Good luck with your hackathon! 🚀
