## 🔥 The Problem & Pain Points

**Enterprise SaaS procurement is broken:**
- **90% of enterprises** struggle with vendor selection, taking 8-12 weeks per decision
- **$2.3M average waste** per enterprise annually on wrong SaaS choices
- **Multiple stakeholders** (CTO, procurement, security, finance) lack coordination
- **Unstructured POCs** lead to 40% implementation failures within 6 months

**Current tools fail enterprises:**
- Review sites (G2, Capterra) provide shallow, consumer-focused insights
- Analyst reports (Gartner) are too broad and generic
- Manual RFP processes take weeks and miss critical requirements
- POC evaluations are vendor-driven and subjective

---

## 📊 Market Gap

**$50B+ Enterprise SaaS Market** with no structured procurement solution:

| Current Solutions | What's Missing |
|------------------|----------------|
| G2/Capterra Reviews | Enterprise-specific evaluation criteria |
| Gartner Reports | Real-time vendor matching & POC frameworks |
| Manual RFPs | AI-powered requirement structuring |
| Vendor-led POCs | Objective, rubric-based evaluations |

**The Gap:** No platform combines intelligent vendor discovery with structured, multi-stakeholder evaluation frameworks.
