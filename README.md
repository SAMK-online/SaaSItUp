> **Transform your enterprise SaaS procurement from chaos to confidence**

Stop wasting months evaluating vendors. Let AI agents guide you through structured, data-driven decisions in days, not weeks.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Enterprise software procurement is broken:
- **8-12 weeks** wasted on unstructured vendor evaluations
- **$2.3M average loss** per enterprise on wrong SaaS choices annually
- **40% of implementations fail** within 6 months due to poor vendor fit
- Multiple stakeholders (CTO, procurement, security, finance) lack coordination
- POCs are vendor-driven, subjective, and impossible to compare

**Current tools aren't helping:**
- 📊 Review sites like G2 → Shallow, consumer-focused insights
- 📑 Analyst reports → Too broad, not actionable
- 📧 Manual RFPs → Weeks to create, inconsistent responses
- 🎯 Vendor POCs → Unstructured, impossible to compare objectively

---
